# Weather App

A website for checking the weather, temperature, windspeeds, humidity levels, sunrise and sunset times in your desired location.
You can choose to view the information in metric or imperial mesurements. Pulls info from [Visual Crossing's Free Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).
Made for an assignment in The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

### What I Practiced While Working On The Project
- Working with asynchronous functions in Javascript;
- Using async/await;
- Working with JSON files;
- Dynamically showing data on the page using Javascript;
- Using APIs;
- Using webpack;
- Designing and creating the page design using HTML/CSS.
